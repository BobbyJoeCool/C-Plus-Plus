CH6-P4: Area Calculator (Multiple Functions)

Goal:
Use multiple functions to modularize calculations.

Task:
- Write:
  - double areaCircle(double r)
  - double areaRectangle(double w, double h)
- In main, ask the user which shape (1 circle, 2 rectangle),
  then read needed values and print the area.

Concepts Practiced:
- multiple functions
- switch or if/else menu
- doubles and formulas
